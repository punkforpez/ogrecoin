# OgreCoin (OGRE)

## Summary
OgreCoin is a Non-Fungible Asset (NFT) created on the official Algorand Mainnet Blockchain on March 7, 2021. It is exists on the blockchain as an Algorand Standard Asset and has a maximum token supply of 1,000,000. OGRE is not divisible in this regard so it is not possible (like most NFTs) to transfer denominations of it and as such 1 OGRE == 1 OGRE, always.

## Use Case
OGRE is primarily used as a quick and simple way to track various goals within a currently synced Blockchain Wallet on the Algorand Blockchain. The main creation of OGRE was to facilitate an incentivized reward system for acquiring other items and monetary values within the actual wallet or on a contrived board of some sort, ie. 1000 OGRE can be traded within my son's digital wallet for 10 ALGO currently or saved later to be exchanged for other items he might want to purchase digitally or through say Amazon.
